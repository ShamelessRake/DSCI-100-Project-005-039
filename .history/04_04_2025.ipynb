    "This is a final project for introduction for data science course in UBC vancouver campus. For this project, each assigned group was given data collected from a research project regarding a minecraft server run by a from UBC club. The data collected record the player information as well as the play sessions of each player in the minecraft research server.\n",
    "The goal of this project is to look for meaningful data and answer some exploratory questions regarding the minecraft research server and player data. Our group decided to explore and try to answer one of the 3 given broad questions, that is “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?”.\n",

    "The specific question we are trying to answer is:\n",
    "#### Can we predict a player's likelihood to subscribe to the server based on age and hours played on a minecraft server in the players.csv data set?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hours played and age act as meaningful and accurate predictors for this specific question as more hours played indicates a higher level of commitment to the game and age can determine the amount of time and money you have available to be able to commit to the server. "

Then, we need to establish a spec, a recipe, a range of K values for our cross validation to determine the most helpful K value, and a workflow. In the recipe, due to the class imbalance seen between subscribed and not subscribed, we will need to oversample to make up for it. For the cross validation, we'll make 5 fold cross,"

    "From what we can see, it appears that **64** offers the best K value for the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The problem with this is that the K value is very high, so it would computationally expensive. Additionally, it very quickly dips in accuracy with the values surrounding it. Therefore, we can look at someting below K= 20. the greatest peak we have is at **K = 17** This value is relatively small so it will be computationally inexpensive. Additionally, the surrounding values appear pretty high as well to it, with much less drastic drops than 64. HOWEVER, it should be noted that the K values exist in accuracy range of 0.1, so maybe multiple K values are possibly. Because of this, it doesn't really make sense to use a K value that large when a much smaller one can give decently similar results. Therefore, we will use **K = 4**. This is very computationally inexpensive, and doesn't have the K's surrounding it deviate too much."

    "This aligns with existing research showing that younger individuals are more susceptible to intensive gaming behaviors, often driven by developmental and psychological factors (Gentile et al., 2011). In contrast, older adults tend to approach gaming differently, often using video games for relaxation, cognitive stimulation, or social connection rather than compulsion (De Schutter, 2011).
